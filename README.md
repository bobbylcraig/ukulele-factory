## About the Aloha Ukulele Factory

It's a Ukulele Factory. If you didn't get that from the name, you've got bigger problems.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

This project has only been tested with the `Apple LLVM version 8.0.0` compiler and the ClamV test server compiler (`g++ (SUSE Linux) 4.8.5`) and is not guaranteed to work with any other compilers. Please only run it in these environments. It may require small tweaks to run with other versions of compilers.

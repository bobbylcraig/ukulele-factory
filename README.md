## About the Aloha Ukulele Factory

It's a Ukulele Factory. If you didn't get that from the name, you've got bigger problems.

## Getting Started

### How to run

To run this program, `cd` into the `files` directory in `rcraig/ukulele-factory/` (absolute: `/home/rcraig/ukulele-factory/files`) and run the following command: `qmake -makefile /home/rcraig/ukulele-factory/files`. From there, run the `make` command and type `./ukulele-factory` to run the program. This should run the `make.cpp` file which has several tests in it. If all assertions pass, you should see a message written to the terminal that says `All Tests Passed`. Success!

### System Requirements

This project has only been tested with the `Apple LLVM version 8.0.0` compiler and the ClamV test server compiler (`g++ (SUSE Linux) 4.8.5`) and is not guaranteed to work with any other compilers. Please only run it in these environments. It may require small tweaks to run with other versions of compilers.
